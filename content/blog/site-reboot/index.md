I had a website around for a long while now, but I ended up neglecting it and never really had the time to write about the topics I wanted to write on - in spite of having many topics to write about. As 2023 progresses, I've managed to clear away some of the various things in life that were eating up my personal time to write more.

So that's all about time, but there were a few other things that were making this process somewhat difficult - web tooling. Originally I was using a ruby app I made many years ago. But it required a database and a rather heavy stack of custom stuff. A few years ago I switched over to using Square Space. I know, as a programmer that's not considered elite. I used Square Space because I didn't want to spend time writing html/css/js. I wanted to spend time writing content.

However, Square Space became difficult after a while, because it didn't suite my preferences for authoring content. I have a nice MBP, but it's a 16" MBP and can be rather large to lug around if I want to write on the couch. I recently picked up an iPad Pro 12.9" and got the Apple Magic Keyboard case (the one with the trackpad). I really like this setup - it's great for writing on. However, authoring a Square Space site where I want to write a lot of code snippets is rather unbearably impossible to do well on an iPad.

I'd known there are a variety of static website tools out there - but I never really looked into them. I was mainly aware of Jekyll but I wasn't super impressed with it. It lacked a lot of functionality I wanted and most of the themes out there for personal sites were pretty plain and uninteresting.

So I took the time to sit down and look at some of the newer/nicer tools. I discovered Hugo, which I spent a number of hours exploring. It has a couple of oddities, but overall seemed like the best tool that fit all my needs quite nicely. The themes out there are much nicer imho, and I particularly liked the blowfish theme, so that's what I'm on now.

So here I am, with Hugo all set up, blowfish theme installed, and everything configured just the way I like it. Now I have to start the process of organizing the topics I want to write on, and then get to writing. We'll see how this goes over time.
