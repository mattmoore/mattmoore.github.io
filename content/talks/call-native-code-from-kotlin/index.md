title: "Call Native Code From Kotlin"
summary: "Kotlin is a great language! But what if you want to call an existing native library in Kotlin, or build your own native library for performance optimizations? This is also useful for making Kotlin a viable option for systems programming. Perhaps there’s an existing C or C++ library that would be great to have available in Kotlin, but it isn’t yet Kotlin-ready? We’ll take a look at how to access native libraries with Kotlin."

Kotlin is a great language! But what if you want to call an existing native library in Kotlin, or build your own native library for performance optimizations? This is also useful for making Kotlin a viable option for systems programming. Perhaps there’s an existing C or C++ library that would be great to have available in Kotlin, but it isn’t yet Kotlin-ready? We’ll take a look at how to access native libraries with Kotlin.
