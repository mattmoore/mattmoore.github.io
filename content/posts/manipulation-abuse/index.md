## Disclaimer

I am not a psychologist. I am an engineer by trade. I do not consider myself the most intelligent person out there. I've been lucky to be smart enough to navigate life and career with very few issues. For this I am very grateful.

When I started on life's journey, I did not realize what would await me. So many good things, and few really terrible things. So far, the good has outweighed the bad. Years ago, little did I know that I would encounter two people that would disrupt and wreck my life in such a disruptive manner that I it would change me forever.

It is not my intention to call these individuals out by name, as I genuinely fear for my life, my career, and so much that I have worked hard to build. To that end, I will give these people different names. The important thing is to call out the behavior, along with red flags I ignored for so long in my interactions with these people, in the hope that others might avoid experiencing the intense pain I endured.

## A Bit of Background

Ever since I was a kid, I was always fascinated by electronics and computers. I began designing and soldering circuitry when I was 8 years old.  But in the realm of electronics I quickly realized as a kid that you had to physically change the circuitry to alter the logic. For this reason, I quickly became obsessed with computers, as to me a computer was a hardware abstraction that allowed software to reconfigure the logic as desired. Eventually I was able to build my first PC before the modern conveniences of ATX boards and snapping components together. And I was absolutely tickled pink. The idea that you could build programs that handled logic rather than having to build custom hardware every time you wanted to change functionality blew my mind.

As I grew up, I soaked up everything I could about electronics, programming, and a few things around physics along the way. Eventually, I went off to college and then graduated in about two years and eight months. Finally I got my first job working for the Air Force.

I would go on to work in many different industries. Aerospace, Healthcare, Finance, to name a few. I continued to enjoy learning more industries and techniques. I met many people along the way; many who were very interesting and some who I made very good friends with. Those friendships became indispensable to future opportunities.

Someone once told me that the hardest problem to solve in engineering companies was people. Over time I began to realize I was good in two areas: I was always able to solve engineering challenges, and I was also generally very good with *people*. That person was spot-on. While engineering had fascinated me because computers were always logical - they followed the exact instructions you gave them - I found that people didn't abide by the same rules. For people, I had to really try to understand psychology. And yet, I seemed to have a natural talent, albeit in need of grooming, to handle.
