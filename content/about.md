Lead engineer at [Xebia Functional](https://xebia.com/) (formerly [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com)).

I am passionate about quality software and functional programming and advanced type systems; from my experience, these two paradigms tend to lead to higher quality software.

I can be contacted by email: matt@mattmoore.io.

<!-- I've always been interested in tech from a young age. At 8 years old, I was building electronic circuits and robotics. I dreamed of having a computer and learning to program. At 10, I got my chance to build my first computer. Ever since then, I've been hooked on programming.

I got my first job working in aerospace at Edwards Air Force Base. It was an awesome learning opportunity for me where I got to work with interesting people, projects and ideas that would form the rest of my future.

After Edwards I transitioned into the healthcare space at United Healthcare where I designed and wrote software for patient charting, controlled e-prescribing, biometrics systems and patient care for the emergency room. I realized I loved working in a collaborative environment with other people who were also passionate about designing cool solutions to solve real-world problems.

I then moved into the Chicago FinTech scene at Enova, where I was responsible for leading teams to dramatically increase revenue through feature development as well as improving legacy and new code and reducing technical debt through architecture initiatives I started and led, including implementing a new payment platform, breaking down monolithic apps into microservices, and code and architecture projects to troubleshoot and improve system performance.

After FinTech, I moved into the HR Tech space where I led a team at Yello partnered with Google to research and implement machine learning algorithms for candidate and job matching. I also led a project to move their platform over to a microservices architecture using Kubernetes.

Next, I went back to healthcare at Rally Health, where I worked on distributed computing and big data problems.

After that, I went to 47 Degrees (now Xebia Functional) to be able to focus more on functional programming paradigms. I've always been in awe of 47 Degrees. -->
